/**
 * v1.3.21 — pure, testable title-based verification for the YouTube nudge.
 *
 * Field log 1784074856214 proved the old mediaId check (`MediaOrchestrator.isCorrectVideo`)
 * was defeated: YouTube's MediaSession does NOT populate `METADATA_KEY_MEDIA_ID` with the
 * deep-link video id, so the check escape-hatched to "true" and confirmed the WRONG video.
 * When the screen was locked, Background-Activity-Launch blocked the switch — YouTube kept
 * playing the PREVIOUS video — yet every entry logged `nudge→confirmed` / `finishReason=ok`.
 *
 * YouTube DOES expose `METADATA_KEY_TITLE` reliably, so we verify by title. The key insight:
 * compare against the title that was playing BEFORE we fired the intent. If the title never
 * changes away from that prior one (and isn't what we asked for), the switch never happened —
 * that's the locked/BAL case, and we must speak the honest error instead of resuming the old
 * video.
 *
 * This object holds only string logic so it runs in pure-JVM tests with no Android deps.
